    "text": "The context for this week‚Äôs Tidy Tuesday dataset is slightly sad and misfortunate as I saw the post from Jon Harmon (@johnthegeek) on Linked In announcing troubles with collecting sponsorships for the R4DS Learning Community üôÅ.\nThis is a very supportive and helpful community and if you are in the position to somehow support them, then you definitely should consider it. I‚Äôve learned a lot from their various channels on Slack, each dedicated to a specific book or topic.\nThis week‚Äôs Tidy Tuesday dataset is about Fiscal sponsors.\nSetup libraries and load data.\n\n\n\n    Downloading file 1 of 1: `fiscal_sponsor_directory.csv`\n\n\nGiven the context - I wanted to take a look at the number of projects that are related to Education or Data Science. Each sponsorship has a project_types column which holds info on the topic of the project. I‚Äôve decided to label a project as educational - if one of it‚Äôs project types (there are several entries possible) contains either of the keywords {Education, Data, Science} (case-insensitive).\nWith this I will try to answer some questions like:\n\nwhat is the share of such projects out of the whole set ?\nare more such projects sponsored over the years ?\nare the number of criteria for such projects to get sponsorship increasing over the years ?\n\n\n\nCode\nfiscal_sponsors &lt;-\n  fiscal_sponsor_directory |&gt;\n  select(\n    name,\n    year_fiscal_sponsor,\n    n_sponsored,\n    project_types,\n    eligibility_criteria,\n    services\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    is_project_educational = str_detect(project_types, \"[Ed]ucation|[Dd]ata|[Ss]cience\"),\n    # \"1987\" -&gt; \"19870101\" -&gt; 1987-01-01\n    year = {\n      year_fiscal_sponsor |&gt;\n        as.character() |&gt;\n        str_c(\"0101\") |&gt;\n        ymd()\n    }\n  )"
