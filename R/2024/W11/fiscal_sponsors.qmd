# Introduction

The context for this week's Tidy Tuesday dataset is slightly sad and misfortunate as I saw [the post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/r4ds_r4ds-online-learning-community-open-collective-activity-7171154003379048449-e8yL) from Jon Harmon ([\@johnthegeek](https://fosstodon.org/@jonthegeek)) on Linked In announcing troubles with collecting sponsorships for the R4DS Learning Community üôÅ.

This is a very supportive and helpful community and if you are in the position to somehow support them, then you definitely should consider it. I've learned a lot from their various channels on Slack, each dedicated to a specific book or topic.

[This week's](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-03-12/readme.md) Tidy Tuesday dataset is about Fiscal sponsors.

Setup libraries and load data.

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| echo: false

library("tidytuesdayR")
library("scales")
library("ggtext")
library("nationalparkcolors")
library("tidyverse")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2024, week = 11)

fiscal_sponsor_directory <- tuesdata$fiscal_sponsor_directory
```

Given the context - I wanted to take a look at the number of projects that are related to Education or Data Science. Each sponsorship has a `project_types` column which holds info on the topic of the project. I've decided to label a project as educational - if one of it's project types (there are several entries possible) contains either of the keywords `{Education, Data, Science}` (case-insensitive).

With this I will try to answer some questions like:

-   what is the share of such projects out of the whole set ?
-   are more such projects sponsored over the years ?
-   are the number of criteria for such projects to get sponsorship increasing over the years ?

```{r}
#| label: prepare-data

fiscal_sponsors <-
  fiscal_sponsor_directory |>
  select(
    name,
    year_fiscal_sponsor,
    n_sponsored,
    project_types,
    eligibility_criteria,
    services
  ) |>
  mutate(
    is_project_educational = str_detect(project_types, "[Ed]ucation|[Dd]ata|[Ss]cience"),
    # "1987" -> "19870101" -> 1987-01-01
    year = {
      year_fiscal_sponsor |>
        as.character() |>
        str_c("0101") |>
        ymd()
    }
  )
```

# Breakdown educational projects ?

```{r}
#| label: is-eductional-proj-breakdown

fiscal_sponsors |>
  count(is_project_educational) |>
  mutate(
    perc = label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(n / sum(n))
  )

```

```{r}
#| label: filter-educational-proj
#| echo: false

educational_projects_sponsors <-
  fiscal_sponsors |>
  filter(is_project_educational)
```

# Educational projects over the years

Plot the number of such sponsored projects over the years. Hopefully we see an increasing trend.

## Takeaways

-   there are some strange quirks in the data which i am not sure how to interpet
    -   there are missing values - seen by the breaks in the lines on the plot
    -   successive years seem to be very "jumpy", not sure if this is realistic ?
-   the general trend is that indeed such projects are increasingly more sponsored over the years
-   there was a first in peak in sponsoring such projects around 1975, with more recent years 2013 reaching back to those record levels
